# Background music

To have "I'm Yours" by Jason Mraz play automatically in the background:

1. Add an MP3 file named **im-yours.mp3** in this folder (`public/music/`).
2. You must have the right to use the file (e.g. purchase from iTunes/Amazon, or use a copy you own).

The app will load `/music/im-yours.mp3`, start it muted (for browser autoplay rules), and unmute on the first tap/click anywhere on the page.

If the file is missing, you can still open the track in Spotify via the 🎵 button.
